== Description ==

Weekly Class Schedule generates a weekly schedule of classes. 

It provides you with an easy way to manage and update the schedule as well as the classes and instructors database. 

Weekly Class Schedule uses Craig Thompson's qTip2 and Brian Cherne's hoverIntent to dynamically display additional information and class/instructor description directly on the schedule page.

== Installation ==
